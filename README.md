</div>

---

### Problem
FLO wants to determine a roadmap for sales and marketing activities. In order for the company
to make a medium-long-term plan, it is necessary to estimate the potential value that existing
customers will provide to the company in the future.

### Dataset
The dataset consists of the information obtained from the past shopping behavior
of customers who made their last purchases from Flo as OmniChannel (both online and
offline shopper) between 2020 - 2021.

There are `12 different variables`, around `20 thousand observations` in the dataset.

`Variable list of the dataset:`

    master_id                          : Customer ID 
    order_channel                      : Channel of the purchase (Android, ios, Desktop, Mobile)
